\section{Data files}
When a detector data file is read to program memory from disk, it is essential that values are assigned the correct real space position before projection onto the Ewald sphere.
\subsection{PILATUS CBF 1.2}
Data is stored in an array much in the same way it appears when looking from the source to the (imagined) detector surface,~i.e. left to right, line by line. The beam center is provided in the header file, with respect to the bottom-left (?) corner of the image, and with the two positive directions right and up (values are approximate unless refined).
